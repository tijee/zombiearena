Rules
-----

### Goal

The goal of Zombie arena is to stay alive as long as possible, escaping and destroying zombies.

### How to play

Zombies and player play alternatively. Zombies move one square each in your direction. If a zombie moves to your square, you lose. As zombies are dummy creatures, if they bang into each other by moving to the same square, they destroy themselves. When zombies are destroyed, they don't die (after all they already are) but they can't move so they are not dangerous to you anymore. However, other zombies can be destroyed if they move to a square occupied by a destroyed zombie. Destroyed zombies can make very helpful protections!

When it's your turn, you can do an action by picking an item from your item list. When you play for the very first time, you'll have only one item: Walk (it's better than nothing). Walk, as its name suggests, enables you to walk one square in any direction you want, except squares occupied by a zombie (even if it has been destroyed). You will earn other items when you level up (see Leveling below). You'll be able to use each item once a game (except Walk that is illimited), but you can reload them: during the game, some bonuses will appear in the arena, containing a random item among the ones you've unlocked.

### Leveling

You level up by collecting stars that will appear in the arena during the game. When you've got as many stars as needed, you gain a level.
